# About
This is command line interface for interacting with the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API, written in Rust. Do note that I only intend to work on support for features included in the free tier. This is currently VERY early in devlopment, and all that can really be done at the moment is make requests to the API for current weather, which is then deserialized into a struct. 

# Goals
I am still fairly new to Rust, so I am using this project as an excuse to get a better feel for the language. One of the motivating factors for building this project is to create a weather widget on my taskbar, and I thought it would be interesting and rewarding to build my own project to make the API calls.
